# Optimized Stock Portfolio

The purpose of this project is to practice accessing and downloading financial data, calculating financial statistics to understand the individual performance of an asset and how groups of assets are related, and how to allocate investments across assets for optimal performance.

I am using PyPortfolioOpt library for this project. PyPortfolioOpt is a library that implements portfolio optimisation methods, including classical efficient frontier techniques.
